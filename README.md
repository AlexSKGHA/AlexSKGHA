- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexSKGHA
- 👀 I’m interested in having fun with friends in Minecraft.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on currently nothing, but in a not so distant feature I guess it'll be our own game, when I get skilled enough in programming ofc.
- 📫 How to reach me (when the moment is right)
